  - Win ‚Üí prompts to play again  
  - Replay resets the board  
  - Quit returns to the title screen

## ‚è∏Ô∏è Pause Menu

- Accessed with the **Esc key** (only during gameplay).  
- Press **Esc** again to resume.  
- **CPU Mode Only**: Includes a difficulty slider.

## ü§ñ CPU Logic

The CPU uses a decision-making algorithm with adjustable difficulty:

- **Winning Moves**: If two of its symbols are in a line, it will complete the win.  
- **Blocking Moves**: If the opponent has two in a line, it will block.  
- **Random Moves**: Otherwise, it places in a random spot.  

Difficulty is controlled by the `CPU Level` (0‚Äì10):

- **0** ‚Üí CPU only makes random moves.  
- **10** ‚Üí CPU always makes optimal moves.  
- Intermediate levels represent percentages (e.g., Level 3 = 30% chance of making a calculated move).  

The CPU difficulty is saved in `CPU Level.dat` and persists between sessions.
